This project is a POC to use websockets in an angular std application.

# Origin
The origin of this whole project is a howto available here: https://medium.com/oril/spring-boot-websockets-angular-5-f2f4b1c14cee

# Modifications
The goal of my modifications is to mimick a defined use case where two kind of people
share the same view on a particular form, and can interact smoothly, to define their
common goal.
